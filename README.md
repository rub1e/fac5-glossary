# fac5 glossary readme  

The purpose of this glossary is to keep a running list of terms and concepts the 5th Founders and Coders cohort have struggled with, or we think future generations of students would thank us for explaining.  

Definitions of terms are not expected to be so basic as to be accessible by complete beginners, but should be written to be of help to those who have completed the FAC prerequisites (i.e. have at least a basic understanding of html, css, and javascript).

# Initial considerations  

I have some ideas about how we should design this glossary, but since this is a resource that we should all use and benefit from, I propose we begin with a consultation period to ensure it can live and grow with us, before being bequeathed to FAC6+.

My initial thoughts/suggestions are below - please have a think about these and any other issues we should have in mind when designing the glossary. 

The consultation period will end on Friday 22nd May 2015 - in the meantime, please submit any terms (with suggested definitions if you like, but not essential) to the temporary glossary file.

## Alphabetical  

Entries should be in alphabetical order. We will need to find a solution that lets us add entries without the need for manual re-ordering.  

## Tags  

Should we have tags like html / javascript / servers / etc.? 

## Further reading

I think the resource should be helpful both in terms of explaining concepts and of guiding the reader to documentation pages / MDN / etc. for further reading.

## Searchable  

There should be a search function  

## Review

We need a system of review to ensure we get it right. To reduce burden on senior members of FAC, I think we should have some sort of pre-review / filter / downvoting system where junior members should refine definitions before they are submitted for final review.

## Submission without definition  

I think that it should be possible to submit terms to be defined without submitting a proposed definition, but this should not be encouraged (!)

## Committee  

I'm quite happy to man the fort on my own for now, but equally happy if there is any appetite for forming an "editorial committee". (This does **not** mean I'm volunteering to be singlehandedly responsible for defining all the terms submitted!!)

## FAC the next generation  

When they join, we should offer to transfer ownership of the resource to FAC6. For a modest fee, of course - just a few hundred quid - let's not be greedy.
